# Scientific Calculator Application

This Scientific Calculator application is a fully functional calculator designed for advanced mathematical operations. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it includes features for trigonometric calculations, logarithms, factorials, memory functions, and more, all wrapped in a responsive Bootstrap-powered interface.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: sin, cos, tan (calculates in degrees or radians).
- **Logarithmic Functions**: ln (natural logarithm) and log (base-10 logarithm).
- **Exponential and Power Operations**: Includes exponentiation (x^y) and square roots.
- **Constants**: Includes Ï€ and Euler's constant e.
- **Factorial Calculation**: Computes factorial for non-negative integers.
- **Random Number Generator**: Generates a random number between 0 and 1.
- **Memory Functions**:
  - M+: Add to memory.
  - M-: Subtract from memory.
  - MR: Recall memory value.
  - MC: Clear memory.
- **Angle Mode Selection**: Toggle between degrees and radians.
- **Input Flexibility**:
  - Button clicks.
  - Keyboard input for numbers, operators, and functions.
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or operations.

## Demo

The application includes a visually appealing interface, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## File Structure

- **HTML**: Main structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Custom styles to enhance the default Bootstrap design.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality for calculator operations and user interactions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/scientific-calculator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd scientific-calculator
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the calculator.

## Key Functionalities in JavaScript

### Angle Mode

- Toggle between degrees and radians using the radio buttons.
- Automatic conversion for trigonometric functions based on the selected mode.

### Memory Functions

- **Add to Memory (M+)**: Adds the displayed value to memory.
- **Subtract from Memory (M-)**: Subtracts the displayed value from memory.
- **Recall Memory (MR)**: Displays the stored memory value.
- **Clear Memory (MC)**: Clears the memory.

### Error Handling

- Displays errors for invalid operations like square roots of negative numbers or factorials of non-integers.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Numbers and Operators**: Use keyboard keys for input.
- **Enter**: Compute the result.
- **Backspace**: Delete the last character.
- **Escape**: Clear the input.

## Dependencies

- **Bootstrap v5.3.3**: For responsive design and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for functionality.
